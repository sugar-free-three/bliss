# Bliss

Bliss is a website that encourages users to take care of themselves and take a break from their stressful day-to-day lives.

In these unprecedented times, it seems like there's stress and bad news everywhere you look. That's why it's important now more than ever to take a break and find things that promote wellness and make you happy! :)

## How we built Bliss
We used HTML/CSS/JavaScript along with the Bootstrap framework to create a beautiful and responsive website.

## Viewing Bliss
Because of the way GitHub pages sets up our project, it's best to view and interact with our website directly thorugh the GitHub pages link. (https://sugar-free-three.github.io/bliss/)
If you must run our project locally, you need to run the project from the directory that houses our project. For example, if our project is 
in /final-projects/bliss, you need to run the project from the final-projects directory and visit our site from localhost::\<port>/bliss.
